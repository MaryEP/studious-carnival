 # Lost #
 
 ### by Emily Dickinson ###
 
 ** I lost a world the other day. **
 
 _Has anybody found?_
    
 You'll know it by the row of stars
    
 Around its forehead bound.
    

 ** A rich man might not notice it; **
    
 Yet to my frugal eye
    
 Of more esteem than ducats.
    
 _Oh, find it, sir, for me!_
