 # Lost
 
 ** I lost a world the other day. **
 
    _Has anybody found?_
    
    You'll know it by the row of stars
    
    Around its forehead bound.
    

    ** A rich man might not notice it; **
    
    Yet to my frugal eye
    
    Of more esteem than ducats.
    
    _Oh, find it, sir, for me!_
